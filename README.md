# IMGIX-UI

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-dnexum)

IMGIX is an image processing service and CDN that has an easy-to-use API via
querystring. it exposes many important transformations and features to make it easy
to have variations on a base image or to be able to apply different types of
optimizations to images.

In addition, it has a sandbox, where we can test each of the features that its api has,
which is a powerful tool because we are generating the final image through
parameters in real time , but with some disadventages.


This application is intended to improve in some way the UX / UI experience, creating 
a new kind of sandbox.

The UI is made up of three views:

* Home

Rotate and Adjust views gives both the chance to apply different options of rotation and adjustment 
with the simplest solution, clicking buttons to get results.
